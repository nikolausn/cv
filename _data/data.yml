career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I am a Ph.D. candidate in Information Sciences from the University of Illinois, Urbana Champaign School of Information Sciences. 
      I also hold a Master's Degree in Information Management from the University of Illinois. 
      I have contributed to diverse communities on Information Sciences research, including network analysis, 
      digital humanities and digital library, data curation, and natural language processing. 
      I am particularly interested in providing a transparent data processing model using provenance information 
      that can be easily queried and analyzed. Data cleaning and preparation are essential for data science workflow. 
      The decision to clean the data to improve data quality or make the data ready to use can also affect the analysis 
      result output. Therefore, it is important to make this process transparent to make it easily auditable and accessible,
      and to some extent can also be reusable and replicable by others.
